# Market Anomaly Detection

This project involves building an anomaly detection system that serves as an early warning mechanism for identifying potential financial market crashes before they occur.

## To-Do List:
### Milestone 1 (main.ipynb)
- [x] Data preprocessing
- [x] Implement ML model for anomaly detection
- [x] Evaluate model performance on test set
- [x] Implement techniques like feature engineering, SMOTE, voting classifiers to enhance performance

### Milestone 2 (Market_Anomaly_Milestone2.ipynb)
- [x] Generate random test data : sim_financial_data.csv
- [ ] Enhance the system by proposing data-driven investment strategy based on the modelâ€™s predictions, focusing on minimizing losses or maximizing returns.

### Milestone 3
- [ ] Design and integrate an AI-driven bot to explain the investment strategy to end users, making it accessible and actionable.
