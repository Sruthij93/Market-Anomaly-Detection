# Market Anomaly Detection

This project involves building an anomaly detection system that serves as an early warning mechanism for identifying potential financial market crashes before they occur.

## To-Do List:
- [ ] Data preprocessing
- [ ] Implement ML model for anomaly detection
- [ ] Evaluate model performance on test set
- [ ] Enhance the system by proposing data-driven investment strategy based on the modelâ€™s predictions, focusing on minimizing losses or maximizing returns.
- [ ] Design and integrate an AI-driven bot to explain the investment strategy to end users, making it accessible and actionable.
